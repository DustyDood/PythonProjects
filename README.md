# PythonProjects

Hello, and thank you for checking out my Python Projects repository!

This repository houses a large number of assignments I completed during the Tech Academy's Python Bootcamp, including:

1. File Transfer Project
  A: A project that incorporated Tkinter and basic file transferring abilties! You select two directories with the tkinter GUI and hit transfer, moving all files from the first directory to the second directory.
  
2. StudentTrackingProject
  A: A project that incorporated Tkinter and basic database connections and functionality! Using a GUI from tkinter, users can create new students, view the information for a selected student, or delete that student's record.

Some of my larger Django projects are in their own respective repositories, such as:

Hello World, Django Edition:
https://github.com/DustyDood/DjangoHelloWorldPractice
  A: This was my first attempt at creating something through Django on my own. Admittedly, it's not very pretty, as I spent the majority of time on Python and JS coding instead of HTML/CSS. Nevertheless, this site allows you to manage a database through a website! You can edit users from a list, update any characteristic of that user, then save the results to the database. You can also make new users or delete old users. This website was great practice for me getting familar with models, views, and templates for Django, not to mention utilizing JS for buttons to interact with Django's views. 

A Django Checkbook Project
https://github.com/DustyDood/Django_Checkbook/tree/master/Django_checkbook
  A: Using Django, I made a website that functions like a basic checking and savings account management system! You can add a user, view a user's transaction information, and add in new transactions for a user.
